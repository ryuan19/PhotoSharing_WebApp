# Photosharing_Webapp
An application where users can post photos, comment on posts, like posts, save favorite posts, see community activity, and more.

This application uses the MERN stack -- MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Everything is run locally, so the webapp is not hosted/available online.

For honor code reasons, I have only uploaded my video demo. If you are interested in the code, please email me at ryuan19@stanford.edu
